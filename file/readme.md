Predict the effective agents in predicting cancer level

In this project we want to reduce features in dataset by feature selection.Actualy we do it a few times to get to a confined features.After that we use PCA to reduce dimension of dataset.The object is to keep accuracy in the process of lowering dimensions and predict the effective agents.In this project we using supervised model in machine learning.In the begining our dataset include 25 features that go short.
